          This site has gone through dozens of iterations in the 20 years that I've owned this
          domain. Beginning as the home of a musical project I worked on as a teenager, it has
          shifted as my priorities changed and is now my professional homebase. Each time I
          introduce a new version of this site I hope to leverage new practices and technologies to
          ensure a modern experience across devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, this site is built using <strong>Vue.js 3</strong> with the
          <strong>Composition API</strong>, embracing modern reactive patterns and TypeScript for
          type safety. The build system leverages <strong>Vite</strong> for lightning-fast
          development and optimized production builds. The entire codebase is written in
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>, providing enhanced developer experience with intelligent
          autocomplete and compile-time error checking.
        </p>

        <p>
          The styling approach uses modern <strong>CSS</strong> features including CSS Grid,
          Flexbox, and custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming. The design
          implements responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across devices, from mobile phones to
          desktop displays.
        </p>

        <p>
          The development workflow incorporates <strong>ESLint</strong> for code quality and
          <strong>Prettier</strong> for consistent formatting. The component architecture follows
          Vue.js best practices with clear separation of concerns, reusable components, and
          maintainable code patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each iteration of this site serves as both a portfolio piece and a learning laboratoryâ€”a
          place where I can experiment with emerging technologies while maintaining a professional
          presence that accurately represents my skills and experience.
